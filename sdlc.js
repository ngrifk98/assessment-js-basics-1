const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step, the software requirements are identified and analyzed to understand the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. It involves gathering information, conducting interviews, and documenting the requirements."
const design = "The design phase involves creating a high-level and low-level design of the software. It includes designing the architecture, database structure, user interface, and other system components."
const implementation = "During implementation, the software is developed based on the design specifications. It involves writing code, integrating various modules, and building the software according to the requirements."
const testingAndIntegration = "In this step, the developed software is tested to identify and fix any defects or issues. It includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the software meets the specified requirements."
const maintain = "The maintenance phase involves monitoring, updating, and modifying the software to keep it functioning properly. It includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and addressing any performance or security issues that arise during the software's lifecycle."
